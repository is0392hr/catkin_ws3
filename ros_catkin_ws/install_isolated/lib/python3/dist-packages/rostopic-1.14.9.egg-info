Description: rostopic contains the rostopic command-line tool for displaying
            debug information about
            ROS <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/Topics">Topics</a>, including
            publishers, subscribers, publishing rate,
            and ROS <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/Messages">Messages</a>. It also
            contains an experimental Python library for getting information about
            and interacting with topics dynamically. This library is for
            internal-use only as the code API may change, though it does provide
            examples of how to implement dynamic subscription and publication
            behaviors in ROS.
